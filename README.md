# 📘 Class 3 | Quarter 3 | GIAIC

🚀 Just explored **Python's core data types and functions**! 💻  
Part of the **Governor Sindh Initiative for GenAI, Web3, and Metaverse**  
🕒 *Shift: Saturday Afternoon*

## 🔢 Python Data Types Covered

- **Lists**
- **Tuples**
- **Sets**
- **Frozensets**

> Learned how and when to use them for **efficient data handling**.

## 🔄 Type Casting

Explored both:

- 🔹 **Explicit Type Casting** (manual conversion)
- 🔹 **Implicit Type Casting** (automatic by Python)
- Also i submit class assignment in this Repo

```python
# Example:
a = 10
b = 3.5
c = a + b  # Implicit casting: int + float → float
Today’s session was all about:

Building a strong foundation in Python data types




Writing clean, optimized functions

Understanding how type conversion affects logic

Let’s keep pushing boundaries and growing our Python skills! 🌱🐍
